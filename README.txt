# Olympic Dam Mobile GIS Repository

This repository contains files for the mobile GIS used during the 
Olympic Dam archaeological surveys conducted by Hughes Environment
& Heritage P/L during 2007-2010. 

The PDF documents contains information on how the files were used 
and explanations of the field names. These manuals were written for
users who had already received some in-person training, so they are
not a complete summary of the entire workflow. 

Most of the other files are the three recording forms that were used 
on TDS Nomad hardware running Windows Mobile 6 and ArcPad 7.1. The 
form itself is an apl file, which is accompanied by a shapefile to 
store the spatial attribute data. The vbs files activate the forms
to perform data checking. The apx and apa files a configuration files
that set the user interface and GPS communications. Except for the 
shapefiles, all files can be viewed and edited with a text editor.

All of these files are free for reuse according to the conditions of 
the licence below.
