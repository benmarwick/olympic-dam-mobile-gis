This repository contains files for the mobile GIS used during the 
Olympic Dam archaeological surveys conducted by Hughes Environment
& Heritage P/L during 2007-2010. 

The PDF documents contains information on how the files were used and explanations of the field names. 

Most of the other files are the three recording forms that were used 
on TDS Nomad hardware running Windows Mobile 6 and ArcPad 7.1. The 
form itself is an apl file, which is accompanied by a shapefile to 
store the spatial attribute data. The vbs files activate the forms
to perform data checking. The apx and apa files a configuration files
that set the user interface and GPS communications. Except for the 
shapefiles, all files can be viewed and edited with a text editor.
